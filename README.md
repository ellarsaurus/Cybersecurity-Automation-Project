# Cybersecurity Automation Project

## Overview
This project automates log analysis, system performance monitoring, and security checks using Python and various libraries such as `psutil`, `scapy`, and `subprocess`.

## Features
- **Log Analysis**: Identifies suspicious logs based on keywords like "failed" and "unauthorized."
- **System Monitoring**: Tracks CPU and memory usage, generates alerts, and sends email notifications.
- **Security Checks**: Automates network scans using `nmap` and monitors network traffic using `scapy`.
